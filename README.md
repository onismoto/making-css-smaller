# making-css-smaller

I think the reason CSS is so confusing for me is that it gives the same treatment to a lot of unrelated concepts.

```css
.thing {
  color: green;
  display: inline-flex;
  background-image: url(img/cat.gif);
  height: 400%;
  transition: opacity 1.2s ease-in-out;
}
```

Hundreds of properties fall under the umbrella of presentation. I like to imagine an alternate reality where separation of concerns extends into categories like typography, placement, size, shape, and motion.
